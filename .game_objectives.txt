GAME OBJECTIVES AND THOUGHT PROCESSES WHILE BUILDING THE PROJECT!!!

the player guesses what cells have mines and what does not!.
LEFT-CLICK on cells without mines to progress in the game

-> if a cell with mine is being LEFT-CLICK, then the game would be over, but if you RIGHT-CLICK on the the cell that correctly has a mine, you are still in the game then.

* THE USER IS GIVEN CERTAIN INITIALIZATIONS
-> the user is being told the number of mines that exists in the cell-graph.
-> the user is being told the number of cells left to be identified as mine-trap or non-mine-trap. 


ANOTHER NOTE:
-> the number revealed on a cell after it has being left-clicked, is to tell the number of cells around itself that has a mine.


THOUGHT PROCESSES
- for a board game (2d) GAME, i would be using the TKINTER library

the window = 800x400

a top-frame = (800-40)x 50
left-frame = 760/

left sidebar to display score

center to display the game

-> create a simple library that saves the settings. settings.py
-> create a simple library that performs utilities to prevent hardcoding of files.


CREATING EVENTS FOR THE BUTTONS/CELLS
events - list of actions to be taken when button is clicked.

event for right-click, and event for left-click.


CREATING THE CELLS FOR THE GAME
- create the cells automatically
- take note of the behaviour of the cells. so that it responds to mouse clicks.

solution ==> object oriented programming
-> create an class called cell, with certain properties, and methods.
then, with for loop, i then instantiate objects of the class into the number of times I need it for.


* a .grid method was used to place the buttons or cells rather than .place method




CREATING AN ALGORITHM THAT PLACES MINES (UNFORBIDDEN CELL LEFT CLICKS) INTO THE CELL GRID

-> a static method that does not take in any parameters-> such self or cls

- how we can store all instances into a list.
  in order to have control on further actions to be taken on the instances.
   i therefore created class methods for this functionality.


-> CREATE A RANDOM LOGIC IN ORDER TO RANDOMISE THE MINES LOCATIONS


EVENT??
- whenever i click on a cell, it should display how many mines surround the cell.
