GAME OBJECTIVES AND THOUGHT PROCESSES WHILE BUILDING THE PROJECT!!!

the player guesses what cells have mines and what does not!.
LEFT-CLICK on cells without mines to progress in the game

-> if a cell with mine is being LEFT-CLICK, then the game would be over, but if you RIGHT-CLICK on the the cell that correctly has a mine, you are still in the game then.

* THE USER IS GIVEN CERTAIN INITIALIZATIONS
-> the user is being told the number of mines that exists in the cell-graph.
-> the user is being told the number of cells left to be identified as mine-trap or non-mine-trap. 


ANOTHER NOTE:
-> the number revealed on a cell after it has being left-clicked, is to tell the number of cells around itself that has a mine.


THOUGHT PROCESSES
- for a board game (2d) GAME, i would be using the TKINTER library

the window = 800x400

a top-frame = (800-40)x 50
left-frame = 760/

left sidebar to display score

center to display the game

-> create a simple library that saves the settings. settings.py
-> create a simple library that performs utilities to prevent hardcoding of files.



CREATING THE CELLS FOR THE GAME
- create the cells automatically
- take note of the behaviour of the cells. so that it responds to mouse clicks.

solution ==> object oriented programming
-> create an class called cell, with certain properties, and methods.
then, with for loop, i then instantiate objects of the class into the number of times I need it for.


* a .grid method was used to place the buttons or cells rather than .place method
